# C++ OOP Implementations


## How to Build and Run

This project uses a `Makefile` for building and running the code.

### Compile the Project

To compile the project, run:

```sh
make build
```

This will compile all source files and place the output in the `build/` directory.

### Run the Project

To run the compiled executable:

```sh
make run
```

This will execute the binary located at `build/main`.

### Compile and Run in One Step

You can also compile and run the project in a single command:

```sh
make
```

### Clean Build Files

To remove all compiled files and the `build/` directory:

```sh
make clean
```
